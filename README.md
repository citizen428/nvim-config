# Neovim config

A Neovim configuration with a focus on leveraging Neovim-specific features and its Lua API.

Some used plugins:

* [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim): plugin management
* [nvim-tree.lua](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua): file explorer
* [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim): status line
* [NVim LSP](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html), [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp),
    [nvim-snippy](https://github.com/dcampos/nvim-snippy): LSP support and autocompletion
* [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter): better syntax highlighting
* [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim): fuzzy finding

## Important Note

I no longer use this config as my daily driver, it's not updated and may not work with newer version of Neovim (which I still use).

## Notes

* Wherever possible I try to use Lua plugins.
* I also try to keep as much of the configuration as possible in Lua, but there are still a lot of `vim.cmd` blocks around.
